Scientific Question:
Does the nsp3 protein contribute to making SARS-CoV-2 extremely lethal and transmittable in comparison to other coronaviruses that are known as the common cold like hCov-229E?

Hypothesis:
f the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic, lethal, and contagious compared to a coronavirus of the common cold like hCov-OC43, then if the genome of the nsp3 protein in SARS-CoV-2 was to be compared to the same genome of hCov-229E, there must be a clear distinction of the two genomes when looking at the alignment or protein structure of the two proteins (specifically the X domain) in the two distinct viruses.
